# **pywoe**

The missing *scikit-learn* addition to work with Weight-of-Evidence scoring, 
with a special focus on credit risk modelling. There's evidently a lack of
open source, free-to-use, well-tested Python package for basic credit risk
modelling tasks. Such a package should provide easily serialisable, deployable,
transferable data validation, feature engineering and feature selection techniques.
It should also be easy to use within the Jupyter Lab framework.

This is still somewhat a work-in-progress, and the package can be extended in 
multiple useful ways. Feel free to contribute.
